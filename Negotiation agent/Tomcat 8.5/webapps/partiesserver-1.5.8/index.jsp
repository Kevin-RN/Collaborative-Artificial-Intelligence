	This server can run parties.

	<h2>Currently running on this server</h2>
	The list of currently running parties is available 
	<a href="runlist.xhtml">here</a>


	<h2>Available Party classes</h2>
	The available party classes are the templates of the parties that can be instantiated/run on this server.
	The server can only run "approved" parties (see "adding/removing" below).
	 <br>
	The parties list with currently runnable parties is <a href="list.xhtml">here</a>.
	<br> 
	The list of party files can be viewed 	<a href="partiesrepo">here</a>. 
	Notice that these may contain files
	with errors, and thus are not available for use (and not appear on the parties list).
